        <p class="components-text">Milk chocolate is a solid chocolate confectionery containing cocoa, sugar and milk. It is the most consumed type of
        chocolate. Chocolate was originally sold and consumed as a beverage in pre-Columbian times. Although four-fifths of all
        milk chocolate is sold in the United States and Europe, increasingly large amounts are consumed in China and Latin
        America.</p>

        <p class="components-text">Semi-sweet chocolate has a cocoa solid content of 35 to 65%. One of the best ways to gain an understanding of this type
        of chocolate is to compare it to a different type of chocolate. Semisweet is darker than milk chocolate. In a taste
        comparison, it has a slightly bitter taste whereas milk chocolate is sweeter and more mellow. This delectable flavor of
        chocolate is very versatile.</p>
